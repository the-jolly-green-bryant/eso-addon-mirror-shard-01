--- Protected Function Workarounds
---
--- This file contains hooks for protected functions that need to be called
--- from potentially tainted/insecure code. These functions use CallSecureProtected
--- to bypass ESO's UI security restrictions.
---
--- CRITICAL: Do not modify these hooks unless you understand ESO's UI taint system.
--- Incorrect modifications can break protected functionality like ability dragging.

--- Hook ZO_ActiveSkillProgressionData:TryPickup to use CallSecureProtected
--- This prevents "Attempt to access a private function from insecure code" errors
--- when dragging abilities after addon code has tainted the UI callstack.
---
--- Original issue: Custom icon hooks would taint the callstack, causing PickupAbilityById
--- to fail with a security error when trying to drag abilities.
---
--- Solution: Wrap PickupAbilityById in CallSecureProtected, which allows calling
--- protected functions even from tainted code.
---
--- PickupAbilityById is used at two callsites. Last check 2025-11-03
